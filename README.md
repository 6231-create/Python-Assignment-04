| Feature        | NumPy Array (`ndarray`)                | Python List                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Speed          | Very fast (C-based)                    | Slower                                   |
| Memory         | Efficient, fixed type                  | Less efficient, stores object references |
| Data Type      | Homogeneous (same type)                | Can store mixed types                    |
| Operations     | Supports vectorized math ,Speed        | Needs loops or comprehensions            |
| Dimensionality | Multi-dimensional support              | Nested lists only                        |
| Functionality  | Many built-in numerical functions      | Limited                                  |
